# Damien TOURDE's resume in LaTeX

## Why ?

I'm not a front-end dev, but rather a DevOps specialist.  
So I don't create a SPA page to show who I am and what I can do, I just build & publish my resume through CI/CD pipeline :)

## Purpose

Repository to host, build and publish my resume.

## Resume

Build with awesomecv class, find it in release section, there is only 1 CV at a time, I publish on the same `latest` tag each time.

## Build your own

My resume is built with AwesomeCV Latex class, created by *posquit0* which you can find [here](https://github.com/posquit0/Awesome-CV).

I modified the font size of paragraph section, space between sections, and removed mail href.
